### What did I do this past week?
The first week was pretty much what I was expecting it to be, a chance to set up all the tools and prepare the environment in order to start working on the projects.  

Although it might have seemed as a slow week, I was impressed by how little time professor Downing wasted before getting us involved in reading and analyasing C++ code. 

I also enjoyed the lecture on friday about assertions and Gtest. As someone who never had the opportunity to encounter unit tests prior to this class, it was a great exposure to the concept.

### What's in my way?

Athough I do have a descent expertise when it comes to coding in C, I have to quickly become familliar with C++ in order for me to be able to make the most out of this class. I have to admit that I always wanted to get acquainted with C++, however, up to this day I always found an excuse for not starting a project with it, now I have no more excuses. C++, let us now be the friends we are meant to be! 

### What will I do next week? 

My current list of tasks still involves increasing my familiarity with the tools necessary for this class, and play more with small C++ projects. I assume the first project was designed for the purpose of getting more familiar with C++ and the tools that are going to be used for the rest of this class, which means that it will be a great opportunity to sharpen those skills even further. Honestly I am not too worried about that, professor Downing seems to have constructed the class in a way that will provide us with a great exposure to a maximum set of tools and industry's best practices, and I am eager to make the most out of it.
